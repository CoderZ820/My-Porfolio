                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Mark.  I'm a father of a wonderful 5 year old girl, a drummer of 28 years and a up and coming programmer<br>
                        with 18 years experience in <em>Tile and Stone</em>.  I think my positive attitude would be a good addition to a team to get the job done.<br>

                    <p>
                        I'm working to become a Web Developer.  This transition is a hard one because I'm completely new to this field.  I've never stepped foot in this industry
                        until now.  I would like to eventually build my own applications, but for now I reallisticly think it will be a few years of just coping or entering data
                        that is created by another team.  But for now, I'm comfortable with taking direction and following what I should be doing until I have enough experience
                        in this industry to move up through the ranks.
